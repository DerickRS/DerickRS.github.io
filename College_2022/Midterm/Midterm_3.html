<p class="p1">What is philosophy? Well its simply just that, <br>
    questioning the rules of nature. To alot of people philosophy is<br>
    quite boring which it can be sometimes. But fundemetally<br>
     it teaches you how to think or how to reason. <br>

<img src="Music1.jpg" class="music1" alt="music theory">
<p class="p2">In some cases music theory can be quite confusing<br> 
    when i first started i had somewhat of an idea of what i was doing<br>
    Music theory is basciallly 8th grade math but obviously with music.<br>
    My end goal for music is to become a composer and make my own music with <br>
    orchestras and real live instruments.<br>

<h3>Web Dev</h3>
<p class="p3">
    When i first started Web Development i thought i would be dropping the class<br> 
    right away. Now a couple months in i can say i quite enjoy it. <br>
    Its challenging but not too much where you feel like quitting.<br> 
        My main goal Sin this course is to become a full stack developer<br>
    and ultimatley get into the robotics field.
