      <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p >Established in 1986, the Kansas City Guitar Society was created to foster appreciation and encourage artistry of the guitar in the greater 
      Kansas City area. The Society is a fully incorporated, 501c3 nonprofit, tax-exempt organization devoted to supporting the art of the guitar. 
      The Society’s primary revenue source is membership contributions. 
      Additional revenue comes from ticket sales, merchandise sales and proceeds from fundraising events. All contributions are tax-deductible.</p>
