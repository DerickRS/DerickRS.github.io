<p>Since i was a young kid i always loved working<br>
     with tools and making little trinkets out of wood. <br>
   I remeber when my grandpa made me a wooden duck out of maple. <br>
   Ever since that day i began to make small trinkets.<br>
    Recently i began making bows and arrows out of maple and oak.<br> 
    Although its a challenge to make it very satifying when they work,<br>
     but when they don't its good for firewood.<br>

<p class="p2">Music has always been a big part in my life.<br>
     Since i was a young lad i would see my unlces playing music at parties with flambouant <br>
   genstures. Since then i've always been interested in music and perfecting the craft.<br>
   I recently began taking guitar lessons and my skills have improved greatly. <br>
    Composing and transcribibing songs on guitar is also alot of fun.<br>

<p class="p3">
    Discovering the human mind is has always been a great endevor by our ancestor.<br> 
   that is no diffrent for me. I have always been facinated how we perseved<br>
    the world and our interaction with the world around us. <br>
    From learning how the ancient philosopher argued the nature of existence <br>
    and perception to the discovery of the structure of the mind by Carl G. Jung<br>
    it is all still a huge mystery to solve and that for me is the fun part about it.<br>
